MobileSimulator
===============

An easy to use mobile simulator for Cordova apps to display on websites. 

<b>Submissions are welcome.</b> 
The mission of this project is to create an iPhone looking and feeling home screen with automatically populated icons that open to a simulated version of the app. <i>This app should NOT be used for testing your products, but as an interactive display to demo your app for customers and clients.</i>
